My About Me page contains several features. It has a navigation bar with links to the homepage, My Profile, and My Music. 

These features will be updated with fuctioning links. Currently My Music has a working link.

My About Me page features a button with hover animations. This button initiates the Guessing Game script. I plan on updating the navigation links with hover animations. I plan on moving the button to the left aside to save space in the article section. 

My About Me page gives a brief discription and list of my favorite table-top games. This area utilizes a scroll feature to make things user friendly.  

The Guessing Game is quite complex. It features randomized responses, a scoring tracker, and questions that provide a limited number of tries. I plan on adding an additional feature that randomizes the order of the questions.
